# Reflections: QueryBot

## What did we learn about Generative AI?

- Capabilities:
  - GenAI (GPT-4) can accurately translate natural language to SQL, especially when grounded with schema and context.
  - Enables non-technical users to access and analyze data with ease.
- Limitations:
  - Struggles with ambiguous, vague, or highly contextual queries.
  - Prompt engineering and schema-awareness are essential for reliable results.

## Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                                  | Solution                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mapping vague queries to correct SQL       | Table-aware prompting and auto-suggestions                    |
| Handling runtime SQL errors                | TRY-CATCH SQL wrapper and safe failure messages               |
| Secure Azure SQL connection                | Environment-level access configuration, scoped credentials    |
| Designing an intuitive interface           | Modern React + MUI, responsive design, clear feedback         |

## Most Valuable Tools & Concepts

- Prompt Engineering: Crafting clear, schema-aware prompts for GPT-4.
- FastAPI & React: Rapid, scalable development for backend and frontend.
- Material UI: Consistent, beautiful, and accessible UI components.
- Session Management: Secure handling of credentials and user state.
- Error Handling: Robust feedback for both backend and frontend errors.

## What would we do next?

- Add more advanced visualizations and export options.
- Implement user authentication and role-based access.
- Add data masking and SQL validation for even greater security.
- Enable session-based query history and refinement.
