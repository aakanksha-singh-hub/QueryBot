## ‚ú® Key Features of the Voice-Enabled Data Interpreter Assistant

### üìÇ 1. Dashboard Explorer: Select a Data Domain
Let users choose the type of data they want to explore, so the assistant understands the context and tailors responses accurately.
**What it does:**
- Presents predefined domains like:
    - üìä Sales Performance
    - üéüÔ∏è Customer Support Tickets
    - üë• Employee Productivity
- Automatically loads:
    - Schema (table/field names)
    - KPI definitions
    - Domain-specific prompt templates

### üß† 2. Domain-Aware Query Handling (Smart Prompting + SQL Generation)
Allow natural language queries like:
"How did North region perform in March?"
"Compare this quarter with the previous one."
**What it does:**
- Translates user query into SQL using GPT
- Handles fuzzy, human-like questions
- Injects schema and KPI context into GPT prompts

### üßæ 3. Natural Language Summary of Raw Data
Go beyond SQL rows ‚Äî explain results in plain English for business users.
**What it does:**
- Converts query results into a concise explanation
- Adds comparison logic (e.g., vs target, vs last period)
**Example output:**
"In March, North region achieved $500K in sales, falling short by $100K from the target of $600K."

### üó£Ô∏è 4. Voice Output (Text-to-Speech)
Let the assistant speak the final answer aloud.
**What it does:**
- Converts text summary into spoken response
- Enhances accessibility and user experience
- Provides a "üîä Speak Answer" button that plays the spoken version of the response.
- Optionally, auto-reads the answer after summarization or successful query execution.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure OpenAI Service
- Azure Speech Service

### Backend
1. Create a `.env` file with your Azure SQL, OpenAI, and Speech Service credentials. Example:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="mssql+pyodbc://user:password@server.database.windows.net/database?driver=ODBC+Driver+18+for+SQL+Server"
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your_azure_openai_api_key"
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/"
   AZURE_SPEECH_KEY="your_azure_speech_key"
   AZURE_SPEECH_REGION="your_azure_speech_region"
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Select a data domain using the **Dashboard Explorer**.
3. Go to **Chat** and ask questions in natural language.
4. View results in a table and as visualizations, along with a **Natural Language Summary**.
5. Click the **üîä Speak Answer** button next to assistant responses to hear them read aloud.
6. Export results as CSV, Excel, or JSON.

## Sample Queries

| Natural Language Input                  | SQL Translation                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| List all departments                    | `SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;`                                                      |
| Top 5 products by sales in 2023         | `SELECT TOP 5 product_name, SUM(sales) FROM orders WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2023 GROUP BY product_name ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC;` |
| Average salary by department            | `SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department;`                              |
| Show total revenue per year             | `SELECT YEAR(order_date), SUM(revenue) FROM sales GROUP BY YEAR(order_date);`                     |

## Prompting Tips

- **Be specific:** Include table or column names when possible.
- **Use filters:** e.g., "Employees with salary over 70000 in Marketing."
- **Avoid vague phrasing:** General inputs like "Show me something interesting" may not yield usable results.

---

## Limitations

- May struggle with vague or highly contextual queries.
- Only read operations are permitted (no updates/deletes).
- SQL errors are caught and shown gracefully, but complex queries may require refinement.
- Sensitive data masking is not yet implemented.

---

## Reflections

See [REFLECTIONS.txt](./REFLECTIONS.txt) for a detailed write-up.

**Summary:**
- GenAI (GPT-4) can accurately translate natural language to SQL, especially when grounded with schema and context.
- Prompt engineering and schema-awareness are essential for reliable results.
- Robust error handling and a clean UI are key for user trust and adoption.
