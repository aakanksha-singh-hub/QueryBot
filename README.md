## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure OpenAI Service

### Backend Setup
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   AZURE_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   AZURE_OPENAI_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview
   AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=your_deployment_name
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the FastAPI backend:
   ```bash
   python backend.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. View available tables in the schema section
3. Use preset queries or type your own natural language query
4. View results, generated SQL, and analysis
5. Use the 'suggest' command to get context-aware query suggestions
6. Use the 'context' command to view current conversation context

### Example Queries
- "Show me all employees"
- "What are the top 5 highest paid employees?"
- "How many employees are in each department?"
- "Show me project performance metrics"
- "Analyze employee performance and contributions"

### Available Commands
- `help`: Show help message
- `context`: Show current conversation context
- `suggest`: Get query suggestions based on current context
- `export <format>`: Export results (formats: csv, sql, excel, json)
- `quit`: Exit the program

## Security Considerations

- All database credentials are stored in environment variables
- SQL queries are validated before execution
- Sensitive data is masked in results
- CORS is configured for security
